# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** October 26, 2023

## 1. Introduction

Welcome to Cardiac Rehab Cardio Planner ("us", "we", or "our"). We are committed to protecting your personal information and your right to privacy. If you have any questions or concerns about this privacy policy, or our practices with regards to your personal information, please contact us at [Your Email Address].

This privacy policy applies to all information collected through our mobile application (the "App"), and/or any related services, sales, marketing or events (we refer to them collectively in this privacy policy as the "Services").

Please read this privacy policy carefully as it will help you make informed decisions about sharing your personal information with us.

## 2. Information We Collect

**2.1. Information You Provide to Us**

*   **Workout Data:** We collect information that you voluntarily provide to us when you create and save treadmill interval sets. This includes details such as duration, speed, and incline for each interval. This data is stored locally on your device and is used to provide the core functionality of the App, which is to help you manage and execute your cardiac rehabilitation cardio plans.
*   **No Personal Identification Information:** We **do not** require you to create an account or provide any personally identifiable information (PII) such as your name, email address, or phone number to use the basic functionalities of the App.

**2.2. Information Automatically Collected**

*   **Usage Data:** We may collect information about how you access and use the App ("Usage Data"). This Usage Data may include information such as your device's Internet Protocol address (e.g., IP address, though often anonymized or aggregated), device name, operating system version, the configuration of the app when utilizing our Service, the time and date of your use of the Service, and other statistics. This data is collected to improve app functionality and user experience.
*   **Crash Reports and Diagnostics:** If the App crashes or experiences errors, we may collect diagnostic information to help us identify and fix issues. This information is typically anonymized and does not directly identify you.

## 3. How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect or receive:

*   **To Provide and Maintain Our Service:** To allow you to create, store, and manage your treadmill interval workout plans.
*   **To Improve Our App:** To understand how users interact with our App and to improve its features, performance, and usability.
*   **To Ensure Technical Functionality:** To monitor and analyze trends, usage, and activities in connection with our Services and for troubleshooting.
*   **For Other Business Purposes:** Such as data analysis, identifying usage trends, and to evaluate and improve our App, products, services, marketing, and your experience.

## 4. Sharing Your Information

We **do not sell, trade, rent, or otherwise share your personal information** with third parties for their marketing purposes.

We may share information in the following situations:

*   **With Service Providers:** We may share your information with third-party vendors, service providers, contractors, or agents who perform services for us or on our behalf and require access to such information to do that work. Examples include data analytics providers or cloud hosting services (though currently, your app appears to store data locally). We will ensure that any third parties we work with are bound by contractual obligations to keep your information confidential and use it only for the purposes for which we disclose it to them.
*   **As Required by Law:** We may disclose your information where we are legally required to do so in order to comply with applicable law, governmental requests, a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process, such as in response to a court order or a subpoena (including in response to public authorities to meet national security or law enforcement requirements).
*   **To Protect Our Rights:** We may disclose your information where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding potential violations of our policies, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person and illegal activities, or as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.

## 5. Data Storage and Security

*   **Local Storage:** The primary workout data (treadmill interval sets) you create is stored locally on your device within the App's private storage.
*   **Data Security:** We use administrative, technical, and physical security measures to help protect your personal information. While we have taken reasonable steps to secure the personal information you provide to us, please be aware that despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable, and no method of data transmission can be guaranteed against any interception or other type of misuse. Any information disclosed online is vulnerable to interception and misuse by unauthorized parties. Therefore, we cannot guarantee complete security if you provide personal information.

## 6. Your Data Rights

Since the App primarily stores data locally and does not require account creation for its core functionality:

*   **Access and Correction:** You can access and modify your workout data directly within the App.
*   **Deletion:** You can delete your workout data by uninstalling the App or by using any in-app data deletion features if provided. Uninstalling the app will typically remove all locally stored app data.

## 7. Third-Party Services (Ads)

*   **Google AdMob:** We may use Google AdMob to serve advertisements within the App. AdMob may use cookies or unique device identifiers to show personalized ads.
    *   You can learn more about how Google collects and uses data by visiting Google's Privacy & Terms page: [https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads](https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads)
    *   You can opt-out of personalized advertising by visiting Google's Ad Settings: [https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated](https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated) (requires Google account) or by adjusting your device's ad settings.

## 8. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. The updated version will be indicated by an updated "Last Updated" date and the updated version will be effective as soon as it is accessible. If we make material changes to this privacy policy, we may notify you either by prominently posting a notice of such changes or by directly sending you a notification. We encourage you to review this privacy policy frequently to be informed of how we are protecting your information.
